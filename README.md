# My Minimal Linux Desktop

## Running with suckless software
Just some basic patches and configurations applied, so this is just a storage.

## No personal scripts included
Because every script is special for its local machine.

## Further configurations are within a plan
I'm a beginner level user for bash and configurations on apps. I do value my time by the way.
